# Database Configuration Management & Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
## Automating Infrastructure and Database Lifecycle with DevOps Best Practices

---

# Executive Summary
This project proposal outlines a comprehensive workshop focused on managing cloud infrastructure and database configurations using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles. It demonstrates how to automate the provisioning of AWS infrastructure and manage database schema versions consistently across multiple environments using tools like Terraform and Liquibase/Flyway. The workshop aims to bridge gaps between DevOps and database operations, ensuring faster deployments, increased reliability, and a standardized approach to configuration management.

# 1. Problem Statement

## Current Situation
- Database changes are often executed manually.
- No version control or rollback mechanism for database schemas.
- Environment drift occurs between dev, staging, and production.

## Key Challenges
- Lack of automation and standardization.
- High operational overhead and risk of human error.
- Delayed deployment cycles.

## Stakeholder Impact
- Developers face inconsistencies across environments.
- DevOps teams struggle with repeatability and scaling.
- Business stakeholders experience slower feature releases.

## Business Consequences
- Increased downtime and system unreliability.
- Slower time-to-market.
- Higher costs in maintenance and incident response.

# 2. Solution Architecture

## Architecture Overview
- Terraform provisions cloud infrastructure (VPC, RDS, IAM, S3).
- Liquibase/Flyway handles schema migrations in CI/CD pipelines.
- GitOps methodology ensures consistency and auditability.

## AWS Services Used
- Amazon RDS (MySQL/PostgreSQL)
- Amazon S3
- AWS IAM
- AWS CloudFormation (optional)
- AWS CloudWatch (monitoring)

## Component Design
- Modular Terraform setup (network, DB, IAM).
- CI/CD pipeline executes migrations post-provisioning.
- Version-controlled configurations stored in Git.

## Security Architecture
- RDS in private subnets with strict IAM policies.
- Secrets managed via AWS Secrets Manager.
- CI/CD access with scoped IAM roles.

## Scalability Design
- Modules support environment duplication (dev/staging/prod).
- Multi-AZ RDS for high availability.
- Reusable components for microservice DB provisioning.

# 3. Technical Implementation

## Implementation Phases
1. Environment Setup (AWS, Terraform)
2. Infrastructure as Code with Terraform Modules
3. Database Schema Versioning Setup
4. CI/CD Integration
5. Environment Deployment and Validation

## Technical Requirements
- Terraform v1.3+
- AWS CLI
- Liquibase or Flyway
- GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins

## Development Approach
- GitOps: Infrastructure and schema changes managed via Git PRs.
- Incremental delivery: one component at a time.

## Testing Strategy
- Terraform plan/apply in sandbox first.
- Validate migration scripts in isolated DB containers.

## Deployment Plan
- Automate provisioning via Terraform.
- Migrations executed in CI pipeline after provisioning.
- Manual approval gates for production.

# 5. Budget Estimation

## Infrastructure Costs
- AWS RDS: ~$50/month (can use Free Tier)
- AWS Networking + Storage: ~$10–15/month

## Development Costs
- Instructor Preparation: $300–500
- Content Creation: $200

## Operational Costs
- Workshop Hosting Tools: ~$30
- CI/CD runner: free (GitHub Actions), or self-hosted

## ROI Analysis
- Reduced deployment time by 50%.
- Lower risk of schema inconsistency.
- Reusable modules accelerate future projects.

# 6. Risk Assessment

## Risk Matrix

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact |
|------|------------|--------|
| AWS cost overrun | Low | Medium |
| Learning curve for Terraform | Medium | High |
| Migration error in production | Low | High |

## Mitigation Strategies
- Use Free Tier or cost alerts.
- Provide Terraform quickstart and hands-on labs.
- Implement backup and rollback strategy.

## Contingency Plans
- Use local or Docker-based databases for demo.
- Manual schema application if CI/CD fails.
- Backup snapshots before running migrations.

# 7. Expected Outcomes

## Success Metrics
- Provision AWS RDS and environments using Terraform.
- CI/CD pipeline runs Liquibase/Flyway successfully.
- Participants complete hands-on labs with minimal issues.

## Business Benefits
- Standardized, repeatable infrastructure setup.
- Lower risk of misconfiguration and data loss.
- Faster and safer releases.

## Technical Improvements
- Modular, version-controlled infrastructure.
- Database schema managed as code.
- Enhanced team collaboration and DevOps maturity.

## Long-term Value
- Apply same patterns across services.
- Reduce onboarding time for new environments.
- Stronger operational resilience.
