# Database Configuration Management & Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

### Overview

This workshop aims to guide learners on how to deploy and manage database infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code (IaC), combined with Configuration Management, to ensure:
- Automation of the process of creating, configuring, and deploying database systems.
- Versioning, rollback capabilities, and configuration change control for databases.
- Applicability to various database management systems such as MySQL and PostgreSQL.
- Hands-on practice with CI/CD deployment, compliance checks, and resource cleanup after use.

Expected outcomes: After the workshop, students should be able to independently design database infrastructure using IaC, effectively manage database configurations, and apply this knowledge in real-world environments (prod/dev/test).
