# Database Configuration Management & Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

### Overview

This workshop is designed to help learners master the process of deploying, managing, and monitoring database infrastructure in a **fully automated, standardized, and change-controlled** manner using modern techniques such as:

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Leverage tools like **Terraform** to model the entire infrastructure (database instances, subnets, security groups, etc.) as version-controlled and auditable source code that can be deployed automatically.

- **Configuration Management**: Automate configuration and management of system parameters, database initialization scripts, backup and restore settings, etc., using tools like **Ansible**, **Bash**, or **AWS Systems Manager (SSM)**.

- **Versioning and Change Tracking**: Establish change management workflows to track current configurations, perform rollbacks when necessary, and maintain a consistent system state.

- **CI/CD-based Deployment Automation**: Integrate infrastructure provisioning and database configuration into **CI/CD pipelines** to quickly launch dev/test/prod environments with minimal manual intervention.

- **Compliance and Configuration Validation**: Enforce security policies, data encryption, and access authentication using tools such as **AWS Config**, **SSM**, or manual checks via Terraform/Ansible outputs.

- **Multi-Engine Support**: The workshop demonstrates applying **IaC and Configuration Management** to popular database engines such as **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL**.

- **Resource Lifecycle Management**: After usage, the environment is automatically cleaned up to prevent unexpected costs and ensure a fresh setup for future deployments.

ðŸŽ¯ **Expected Outcomes:**  
By the end of this workshop, learners will:
- Understand the end-to-end architecture of a database system deployed via IaC.
- Learn how to develop and reuse IaC templates for different types of databases.
- Gain practical experience in change control, rollback mechanisms, and CI/CD integration.
- Be able to apply these practices in real-world environments including development, staging, and production.
