In this section, we will focus on **managing and configuring the database** that has been deployed through Infrastructure as Code (IaC).  
After completing the infrastructure deployment and establishing the connection between public and private EC2 instances, the next step is to configure the database environment to meet the applicationâ€™s requirements.

This will include:
- Installing and configuring the database software.
- Applying the initial database schema or sample data.
- Adjusting security and performance settings.
- Testing connectivity between application components and the database.

By the end of this section, you will have a fully configured database environment, ready for deployment in a simulated production setting.
